# NPC Robbery Script for RedM (VorpCore)

This is my **first release**, and the script may not be optimally written. Feel free to provide feedback or suggestions for improvements!  

This script allows players to rob NPCs by aiming at them with a revolver or pistol. NPCs will either surrender and give money or fight back.

## üìå Features
- NPCs can **surrender** and hand over money.
- NPCs can **fight back** using fists or a revolver.
- NPCs freeze during the decision-making process.
- Configurable settings for **surrender chance, money drop, and weapon chance**.
- Integrated **animation** for money handover.

## üîß Installation
1. Download and place the script in your `resources` folder.
2. Add `ensure owc_robbery` to your `server.cfg`.
3. Restart your server.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`Config.lua`)
